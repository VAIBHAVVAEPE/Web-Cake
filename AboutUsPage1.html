    <h1> About Us</h1>


    <div class="banner2">
        A cakery or cake shop is a retail business specializing 
        in producing and/or selling cakes; they may also sell cupcakes,
        muffins, sponges, as well as other baked goods that fall under the 
        title of a cake. Cake shops may also sell equipment and supplies for 
        home cake baking, especially for cake decorating, but not all do this. 
        Another common but not universal sideline is special orders such as wedding
        cakes and elaborate birthday cakes.

        Products are baked on site in the same manner
        to that of a bakery but does not make or sell other 
        associated items. The term "cakery" may sometimes be used to get
        around the fact that "bakery" or "bakeries" have been taken as a name for many 
        long established businesses and new entrants want to stand out.
